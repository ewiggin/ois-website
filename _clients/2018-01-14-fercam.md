In more than 65 years of company history, starting out as a small local haulier, FERCAM has become one of Europes' integrated logistics leaders: an evolution that started with full truck loads by road and rail, arriving at national and international road deliveries, followed by air and ocean freight. All these services are consolidated by the many large logistics centres, which today represent the hallmark of our offer.

Today, FERCAM is a multi specialised logistics operator. The ongoing investments and the flexibility to adapt to the necessities of an evolving market and of its clients have always been our strong point.
FERCAM is your supply chain company, thanks to a network of branches located all over Europe and in non-EU Countries, the enthusiasm and the motivation of thousands of direct employees and collaborators, 897.000 m2 of logistics centres, a big fleet of company owned vehicles and innovative I.T.-solutions.

FERCAM Logistics & Transport. The pleasure of knowing you are in safe hands.
